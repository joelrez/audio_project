## Introduction
In this project, I am simulating recordings to better understand sound and signal processing. I have two interests in this subject:
* I want to understand music more. I was inspired by the creation of new musical instruments such as the [harpeji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr87Z7rZiWE). I wonder why exactly we need to limit ourselves to simple traditional instruments. ![image](https://github.com/joelrez/audio_project/assets/32008471/5aa25593-cf49-4712-8e9a-b0f5fea54bc2)
* I want to understand how the sound coming from an object moving around in a space affects the audio recording. For this, I am attempting to apply the [inverse square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law) to an object moving in a 2D space where it is assumed we know the locations of the object and microphone, but we (I) don't know how the signal attenuates given the distance.
